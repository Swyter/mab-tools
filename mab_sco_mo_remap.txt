# swy: this is a sample file that «mab_sco_unpacked_reindex» can read to rename (i.e. remap) props in your scenes;
#      you can either double click mab_sco_mo_remap_all.cmd directly (it will run for all .sco files in your
#      SceneObj folder, so careful about that) or use it as reference to easily adapt it to your needs.
